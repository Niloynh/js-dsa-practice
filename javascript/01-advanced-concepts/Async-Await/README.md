# Async–Await Challenge: Error Handling

This is my daily JavaScript challenge focused on mastering **Promises**, **async–await**, and **error handling**.

### 🟪 Challenge: Error Handle  
The task was to create a function that sometimes resolves and sometimes rejects, then handle it using `try–catch`.

### 📌 What I practiced:
- Creating custom Promises  
- Using async–await  
- Understanding resolve & reject  
- Handling errors with try–catch  
- Simulating API calls using setTimeout
