✅ Day 1: Two Sum problem solved

🌟 Overview

This repo contains the JavaScript solution to the classic Two Sum problem from LeetCode — comparing both Brute Force and Optimized Hash Map approaches to understand time complexity and efficiency.

💡 Problem

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [0, 1] // because 2 + 7 = 9

⚙️ Solutions
Approach	Description	Time	Space
🐢 Brute Force	Check all pairs using nested loops	O(n²)	O(1)
⚡ Hash Map	Store values for instant lookup	O(n)	O(n)
